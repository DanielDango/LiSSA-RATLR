\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:Introduction}
During software development, numerous artifacts are created, ranging from the actual project code to documentation and a multitude of formal and informal diagrams.
\TLR aims to link correlating artifacts across different domains or versions.
Further complications such as inconsistent naming are frequent issues in software projects~\cite{wohlrab2019ImprovingConsistency}.
\TLR approaches need to be able to deal with all these challenges.

    Artifacts are presented in white rounded boxes.
    Existing \TLs between artifacts are highlighted with red dashed arrows.
    The background colors indicate different domains of artifacts.

\autoref{fig:artifact_overview} provides an overview of what these artifacts might look like.
We can see various snippets of a larger project, including requirements, source code, architectural diagrams, and documentation.
For instance, we have the requirement that a \REST \API should be used.
In the documentation, we can read that \REST is used to process images.
The source code shows us that the \method{Image} class is used by the \method{\REST Facade}.
A \TL likely exists between the \method{\REST Facade} and the \REST requirement.
Furthermore, the documentation snippet likely describes the relation between the \method{\REST Facade} and \method{Image}.
So a \TL should exist between them as well.
We can also note naming inconsistencies for the database.
In the architectural diagram, it is referred to as \method{Database}.
At the same time, the source code uses the abbreviated \method{Db} identifier.
Technically, with just the knowledge displayed in \autoref{fig:artifact_overview}, we can not even be certain that \method{Db} is used to abbreviate database.
The documentation does not mention a database at all.
However, we can infer that \method{Db} is likely a database because it is used in the \method{\REST Facade} class, which is getting images from somewhere.


This example illustrates that a multitude of factors need to be considered for \TLR. 
Aside from or rather especially with naming inconsistencies, we need to consider more information to establish \TLs correctly.
\Acp{LLM} have made rapid advancements in recent years.
They are becoming increasingly popular for dealing with \TLR tasks and have shown auspicious results so far.
\Todo{This needs proof, sowas sollte belegt werden. du redest hier über trends. LMs wurden schon davor für TLR etc. verwendet :)
Hier mind. Zitate, die aktuell sind und TLR mit LLMs machen

As they are still unable to reason and think on their own~\cite{shojaee2025IllusionThinking}, prompt engineering is required to extract good results.
\Todo{Wissen wir das? Quellen?}
However, manually determining prompts suited for each specific problem is quite a tedious, time- and labor-intensive task.
The goal is to determine, whether the current prompts can be refined further.
If this proofs to be promising we also want reduce the overall effort required for \TLR instead of just shifting the task from manual classification to prompt engineering.
To address this shortcoming, \APO tools can be used.
They typically use the \LLM itself to determine suitable adjustments or generate new prompts based on a description or training data of the problem~\cite{ramnath2025SystematicSurvey}.

The \LiSSAf proposes an environment for \TLR tasks, including multiple pipeline steps for preprocessing of input data.
They rely on the power of \LLMs to extract traceability links from a variety of different artifacts, also across multiple domains.
My work contributes an \APO component to this framework.
It can be used to automatically refine a prompt on a dataset and optionally chain the optimization with the regular evaluation pipeline of the \LiSSAf
I am expecting to improve \TLR rates, especially for larger projects in the \RtR domain.

This thesis aims to answer the following research questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[RQ1:] Can \APO be used to improve \TLR performance in the \LiSSAf?
    \item[RQ2:] How does the performance of the optimized prompt compare to the current classification prompts?
    \item[RQ3:] Can optimized prompts improve \TLR performance for untrained datasets?
\end{itemize}

The remainder of this thesis is structured as follows:
\autoref{ch:foundations} introduces the necessary fundamentals and related work in \autoref{ch:related_work}.
\autoref{ch:Approach} describes the concept of the proposed \APO component.
\autoref{ch:Implementation} details the implementation of the concept.
\autoref{ch:Evaluation} evaluates the implementation and answers the research questions.
Finally, \autoref{ch:Conclusion} concludes the thesis and gives an outlook on possible future work.
