Question: Determine the direct or indirect link between two software development artifacts from the domain of requirements, focusing on connections within the scope of requirement\-to\-requirement traceability.\newline

            \{source\_type\}: \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\{source\_content\}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\newline
\newline
            \{target\_type\}: \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\{target\_content\}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\newline
\newline
            Classify the relationship as:\newline
            \- Direct: a clear and explicit connection between the two artifacts\newline
            \- Indirect via functional requirement: an indirect connection through one or more functional requirements\newline
            \- Indirect via non\-functional requirement: an indirect connection through one or more non\-functional requirements\newline
            \- No connection: no direct or indirect link exists between the two artifacts
