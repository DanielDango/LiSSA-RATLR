Question: You are given two parts of software development artifacts that need to be analyzed for traceability link recovery in the domain of requirement to requirement.\newline
\newline
\{source\_type\}: \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\{source\_content\}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\newline
\newline
\{target\_type\}: \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\{target\_content\}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\newline
\newline
Carefully examine the content and context of both artifacts. Consider factors such as terminology, objectives, dependencies, and any implicit or explicit connections. Assess whether they share common goals, constraints, or functionalities. Pay close attention to shared terminology, aligned objectives, or mutual dependencies. Determine if they are related in terms of requirements by evaluating the presence of these elements.\newline
