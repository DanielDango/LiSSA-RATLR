Question: You are given two parts of software development artifacts that need to be analyzed for traceability link recovery in the domain of requirement to requirement. Carefully examine the content provided below:\newline
\newline
\{source\_type\}: \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\{source\_content\}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\newline
\newline
\{target\_type\}: \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\{target\_content\}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\newline
\newline
Based on the information and context provided, determine if there is a traceability link between these two artifacts. Consider factors such as shared terminology, similar objectives, dependencies, and any direct or indirect relationships. Pay attention to the context and nuances in the language used, as well as any implicit connections that may not be immediately obvious. Evaluate the alignment of goals, the consistency of terminology, and the presence of any logical or functional dependencies. Are they related?\newline
