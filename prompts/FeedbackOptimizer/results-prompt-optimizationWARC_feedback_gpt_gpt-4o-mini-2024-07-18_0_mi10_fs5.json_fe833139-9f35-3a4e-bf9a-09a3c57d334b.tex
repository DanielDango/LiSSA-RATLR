Question: Here are two parts of software development artifacts.\newline
\newline
            \{source\_type\}: \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\{source\_content\}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\newline
\newline
            \{target\_type\}: \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\{target\_content\}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\newline
            Are they related in terms of functionality, purpose, or requirements? Specifically, evaluate if the target requirement supports, clarifies, or expands upon the source requirement. Consider whether the target requirement directly addresses the same aspect of functionality, provides necessary details that enhance the understanding of the source requirement, or aligns with the intent of the source requirement.\newline
\newline
            Focus on the relationship between the two requirements, ensuring that any mention of implementation or structural details in the target requirement is directly relevant to the core functionality described in the source requirement. Pay special attention to whether the target requirement reinforces the essential functionality or purpose of the source requirement, rather than merely providing additional context or implementation specifics that do not directly relate to the source requirement\textquotesingle{}s intent.\newline
\newline
            Additionally, assess if the target requirement describes aspects such as compatibility, structural organization, or encapsulation that are crucial to understanding the source requirement\textquotesingle{}s intent. Ensure that the target requirement does not introduce unrelated implementation details or abstract concepts that do not directly support the source requirement\textquotesingle{}s core functionality.\newline
\newline
            Be particularly vigilant for requirements that may seem related but focus on implementation details, structural organization, or compatibility rather than the core functional intent of the source requirement.\newline
\newline
            If the target requirement elaborates on the functionality, purpose, or essential characteristics of the source requirement without diverging into unrelated implementation specifics, answer with \textquotesingle{}yes\textquotesingle{}. Otherwise, answer with \textquotesingle{}no\textquotesingle{}.
