Question: Here are two parts of software development artifacts.\newline
\newline
\{source\_type\}: \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\{source\_content\}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\newline
\newline
\{target\_type\}: \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\{target\_content\}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\newline
\newline
Consider the following when determining if they are related:\newline
1. Look for common themes or concepts, such as specific file names, structures, or functionalities. Pay attention to terms like "single header file" or specific file names like "warc.h".\newline
2. Identify if one requirement directly supports, implements, or complements the other. Consider if one requirement provides a rationale or context for the other.\newline
3. Check if both requirements refer to the same component or feature, even if described differently. Look for synonyms or related terms that might indicate a connection.\newline
4. Evaluate if the requirements collectively contribute to a common goal or functionality, even if they describe different aspects of it.\newline
5. Consider the intent and purpose behind each requirement. Determine if they are aimed at achieving the same outcome or facilitating the same process.\newline
6. Analyze the language used in both requirements to identify any implicit connections or dependencies that may not be immediately obvious.\newline
7. Pay special attention to the structure and hierarchy of the components mentioned. Determine if the requirements describe different layers or levels of the same system.\newline
8. Consider the broader context of the requirements. Determine if they are part of a larger system or framework that inherently links them together.\newline
9. Specifically assess if the requirements mention the inclusion or use of a single header file as a central theme, and if they describe how this file is utilized or structured within the system.\newline
10. Look for any explicit or implicit references to the same functionalities or features, such as the ability to access, modify, or manipulate components through the mentioned header file.\newline
\newline
Are they related?\newline
