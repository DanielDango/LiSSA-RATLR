Question: Are these two parts of software development artifacts related in terms of their functional requirements, specifically regarding the inclusion and access of header files?\newline
\newline
            \{source\_type\}: \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\{source\_content\}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\newline
\newline
            \{target\_type\}: \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\{target\_content\}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\newline
            Answer with \textquotesingle{}yes\textquotesingle{} if they are related to the same requirement or concept \(e.g., single entry point, hierarchical structure, access to WARC file format\), otherwise answer with \textquotesingle{}no\textquotesingle{}. Consider the following keywords: "single header file", "entry point", "hierarchical manner", and "access to WARC file format" when evaluating the relationship between the two requirements.
