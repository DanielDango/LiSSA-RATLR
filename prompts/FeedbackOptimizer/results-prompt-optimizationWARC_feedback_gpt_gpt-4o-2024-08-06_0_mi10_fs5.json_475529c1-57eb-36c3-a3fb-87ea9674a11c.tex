Question: Here are two parts of software development artifacts.\newline
\newline
\{source\_type\}: \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\{source\_content\}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\newline
\newline
\{target\_type\}: \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\{target\_content\}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\newline
\newline
Consider the following when determining if they are related:\newline
1. Identify shared terminology or concepts, such as specific functions, interfaces, standards, or types of records mentioned in both requirements. Pay attention to synonyms or closely related terms that may indicate a connection.\newline
2. Evaluate whether one requirement describes a functionality or feature that directly supports, complements, or is necessary for the implementation of the other. Consider if one requirement provides a foundation or prerequisite for the other.\newline
3. Determine if there is a dependency, logical connection, or encapsulation relationship between the two requirements, such as one requirement ensuring compatibility, compliance, or abstraction that the other relies on. Consider if changes in one requirement would impact the other.\newline
4. Assess if both requirements contribute to a common goal, objective, or aspect of the software system, such as ensuring standard compliance, providing a universal interface, or enhancing system robustness.\newline
5. Consider if the requirements address different aspects of the same feature or functionality, such as creation, management, or processing of records. Look for complementary roles or responsibilities that together fulfill a broader requirement.\newline
6. Analyze if the requirements involve similar actions or processes, such as creating, managing, or processing records, and if they are part of a sequence or workflow that connects them.\newline
7. Reflect on whether the requirements share a common context or domain, which might imply a relationship even if the direct connection is not immediately obvious.\newline
8. Pay special attention to the presence of universal interfaces, encapsulation, and compliance with standards, as these are critical aspects that often indicate a relationship between requirements in this domain.\newline
9. Examine if both requirements mention or imply the use of a universal header or interface, as this is a key indicator of a relationship in this context.\newline
10. Consider if the requirements involve the same or related types of WARC records, as this can suggest a direct or indirect relationship.\newline
11. Look for explicit mentions of memory management, remote management, or other specific functionalities that might indicate a relationship, even if not directly related to WARC records.\newline
12. Consider the broader context of the requirements, such as the overall architecture or design principles they support, to identify indirect relationships.\newline
13. Pay attention to the specific phrasing and structure of the requirements, as similar language or structure can indicate a relationship.\newline
14. Consider the intent and purpose behind each requirement, as aligning intents can suggest a relationship even if the specifics differ.\newline
15. Evaluate if the requirements mention or imply the need for compatibility or interoperability, as this can indicate a relationship.\newline
16. Consider if the requirements address scalability, performance, or optimization aspects that might be interrelated.\newline
17. Look for any implicit or explicit dependencies that might not be immediately obvious but are crucial for the system\textquotesingle{}s functionality.\newline
18. Pay attention to the specific types of WARC records mentioned and whether they are addressed in both requirements, as this can indicate a direct relationship.\newline
19. Consider if the requirements mention or imply the need for a single header file or universal interface, as this is a critical aspect in this domain.\newline
20. Reflect on whether the requirements address encapsulation or abstraction, as these are key concepts that often indicate a relationship.\newline
\newline
Are they related?\newline
\newline
Answer with \textquotesingle{}yes\textquotesingle{} or \textquotesingle{}no\textquotesingle{}.
