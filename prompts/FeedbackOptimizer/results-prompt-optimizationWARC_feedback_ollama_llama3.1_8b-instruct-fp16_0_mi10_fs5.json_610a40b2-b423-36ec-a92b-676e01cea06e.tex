Question: Are these two requirements related in terms of traceability, specifically regarding the structure or interface of libwarc?\newline
\newline
\{source\_type\}: \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}FR\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{} \| \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}SRS\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\newline
\{source\_content\}\newline
\newline
\{target\_type\}: \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}FR\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{} \| \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}SRS\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\newline

Answer with \textquotesingle{}yes\textquotesingle{} if they are related \(e.g., one requirement is a refinement or implementation detail of another, describe different aspects of the same concept, have a causal relationship\), and \textquotesingle{}no\textquotesingle{} otherwise.\newline
\newline
Specifically, consider the following relationships:\newline
\- One requirement refines or implements another.\newline
\- Requirements describe different aspects of the same concept \(e.g., structure vs. interface\).\newline
\- Requirements have a causal relationship \(e.g., one requirement implies or necessitates another\).\newline
\- A functional requirement is related to a structural requirement if they are both relevant to the same libwarc component or feature, such as:\newline
  \- A single header file requirement being related to a hierarchical structuring of headers.\newline
  \- An interface requirement being related to an encapsulation of internal functionality.\newline
  \- A compatibility requirement being related to a single entry point.\newline
\- Requirements that mention the same libwarc entity \(e.g., "libwarc", "warc.h"\) are considered related.\newline
\- Additionally, consider requirements as related if they address complementary aspects of the same concept, such as:\newline
  \- A requirement specifying what is required \(functional\) and another requiring how it should be achieved \(structural\).\newline
  \- A requirement describing a feature or component and another detailing its implementation or interface.\newline
\newline
To improve classification accuracy, we will also consider relationships between requirements that describe different views or perspectives on the same libwarc concept. For example:\newline
\- Requirements that mention "libwarc" in the context of software tool or application usage are related to requirements that specify how libwarc should be structured or interfaced.\newline
\- Requirements that discuss the internal implementation of libwarc are related to requirements that describe its external interface.\newline
\newline
Note: The classification result should be \textquotesingle{}yes\textquotesingle{} if the requirements are related in terms of traceability, and \textquotesingle{}no\textquotesingle{} otherwise.
