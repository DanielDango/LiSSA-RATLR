Question: Here are two parts of software development artifacts.\newline
\newline
\{source\_type\}: \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\{source\_content\}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\newline
\newline
\{target\_type\}: \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\{target\_content\}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\newline
\newline
Consider the following when determining if they are related:\newline
1. Identify shared terminology, concepts, or standards, such as specific functions, interfaces, or compliance requirements mentioned in both requirements. Pay attention to any specific names, versions, or standards that are explicitly referenced.\newline
2. Evaluate whether one requirement describes a feature or functionality that directly supports, complements, or is necessary for the implementation of the other. Consider if one requirement provides a foundational or enabling capability for the other.\newline
3. Determine if there is a dependency, logical connection, or mutual goal between the two requirements, such as one requirement ensuring compatibility, compliance, or functionality that the other relies on. Look for any explicit or implicit dependencies.\newline
4. Consider the broader context and purpose of each requirement to identify any indirect relationships or overarching objectives they may share. Evaluate if they contribute to a common goal or system\-wide functionality.\newline
5. Analyze the structure and phrasing of the requirements to identify any implied relationships or connections that may not be immediately obvious.\newline
6. Pay special attention to the role of universal interfaces or headers, as they often serve as a bridge between different functionalities or components, indicating a potential relationship.\newline
7. Consider the implications of encapsulation and abstraction in the requirements, as these concepts often suggest a relationship by isolating changes and ensuring compatibility across different components or versions.\newline
8. Look for any specific references to the same types of records, functions, or interfaces, as these can indicate a direct relationship or shared objective.\newline
9. Assess if the requirements address similar challenges or solutions, which may suggest a relationship even if not explicitly stated.\newline
\newline
Are they related?\newline

Answer with \textquotesingle{}yes\textquotesingle{} or \textquotesingle{}no\textquotesingle{}.
