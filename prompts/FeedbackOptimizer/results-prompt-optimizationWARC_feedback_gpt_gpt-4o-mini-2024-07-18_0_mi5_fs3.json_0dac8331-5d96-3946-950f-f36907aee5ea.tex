Question: Here are two parts of software development artifacts.\newline
\newline
            \{source\_type\}: \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\{source\_content\}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\newline
\newline
            \{target\_type\}: \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\{target\_content\}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\newline
            Are they related in terms of functionality, requirements, or specifications? Consider whether the target requirement supports, elaborates on, or is a direct consequence of the source requirement. Pay special attention to whether the target requirement describes aspects, structures, or functionalities that are directly linked to the source requirement\textquotesingle{}s intent. Specifically, evaluate if the target requirement provides additional details, clarifications, or implementations that align with the core purpose of the source requirement, particularly in terms of the same functionality or design principles.\newline
\newline
            Additionally, assess if the target requirement introduces new concepts or structures that complement the source requirement without contradicting its core intent. If the target requirement expands on the source requirement by detailing how the functionality will be achieved or structured, it may indicate a relationship.\newline

            Answer with \textquotesingle{}yes\textquotesingle{} or \textquotesingle{}no\textquotesingle{}.
