The current prompt is not performing well in classifying the following trace links.
To help you improve the prompt, I will provide examples of misclassified trace links. 
Please analyze these examples and adjust the prompt accordingly. 
The examples are as follows: \\
\{identifier\}\\
\{source\_type\}: \tripplequote\{source\_content\}\tripplequote\\
\{target\_type\}: \tripplequote\{target\_content\}\tripplequote\\
Classification result: \{classification\}
