Below are two artifacts from the same software system. A traceability link exists if one artifact directly references, supports, or is derived from the other in terms of requirements, design, or implementation. Based on this definition, is there a traceability link between \(1\) and \(2\)?\newline
\# output format\newline
Give your reasoning and then answer with \textquotesingle{}yes\textquotesingle{} or \textquotesingle{}no\textquotesingle{} enclosed in <trace\> </trace\>.\newline
\# input format\newline

\(2\) \{target\_type\}: \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\{target\_content\}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}.\newline
