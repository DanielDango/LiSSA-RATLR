\# task\newline
Evaluate the following two artifacts from a software system. The first artifact describes a non\-functional requirement \(NFR\), which outlines a quality attribute that the system must meet, such as performance, security, or usability. The second artifact details a specific software requirement \(SRS\), which defines a particular functionality or feature of the software. Analyze the content of both artifacts and determine if the software requirement directly addresses or fulfills the non\-functional requirement. Respond with \textquotesingle{}yes\textquotesingle{} if there is a clear connection indicating that the software requirement supports the non\-functional requirement, and \textquotesingle{}no\textquotesingle{} if there is no such connection.\newline
