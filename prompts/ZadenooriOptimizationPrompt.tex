\begin{prompt}{Zadenoori Optimization Prompt}{zadenoori_optimization}\\
     You are required to enhance and clarify the explanations of the categories in the prompt by integrating illustrative examples and information implicitly referenced in the initial context. \\
     The optimized prompt must follow these strict guidelines: \\
     Maintain the Original Steps: The steps in the optimized prompt must remain exactly the same as in the sample prompt; no changes should be made to the stepsâ€™ structure or order. \\
     Expand Explanations: Enrich and expand the explanations of each category within the steps, incorporating examples provided.
     Use these examples to enhance understanding and provide clarity, but ensure all content remains within the existing steps and does not extend beyond them. \\
     Incorporate Class Explanations: Specifically, integrate the detailed "Class Explanations" of categories from the first prompt into the optimized prompt.
     For each category, introduce implicit clarifications based on relevant data extracted from the context, keeping all additions within the boundaries of the original steps. \\
     End Strictly After Step 5: The optimized prompt must strictly end after step 5.
     Do not add any additional steps, conclusions, or content beyond this point. \\
