Question: We have two software development artifacts that may or may not be related in terms of their purpose, functionality, or requirements.\newline
\newline
Source Artifact \(\{source\_type\}\): \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\{source\_content\}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\newline
\newline
Target Artifact \(\{target\_type\}\): \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\{target\_content\}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\newline
\newline
Please analyze the content of both artifacts and determine if they are related. For the purpose of this analysis, consider the following criteria:\newline
\newline
1. \*\*Purpose\*\*: Assess whether both artifacts aim to achieve a similar goal or objective within the software development process. Are they intended for the same type of user or use case?\newline
2. \*\*Functionality\*\*: Evaluate if both artifacts provide similar features or capabilities. Do they perform comparable tasks or operations?\newline
3. \*\*Requirements\*\*: Determine if both artifacts address the same requirements or constraints. Are they designed to meet similar standards or specifications?\newline
\newline
Please provide a detailed explanation of your reasoning for each criterion before concluding with \textquotesingle{}yes\textquotesingle{} if they are related, or \textquotesingle{}no\textquotesingle{} if they are not related.
