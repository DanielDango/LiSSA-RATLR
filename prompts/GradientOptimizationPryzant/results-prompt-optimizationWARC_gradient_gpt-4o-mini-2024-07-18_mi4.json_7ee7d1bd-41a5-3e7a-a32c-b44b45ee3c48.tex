Question: We have two software development artifacts that may or may not be related in terms of their purpose, functionality, or requirements.\newline
\newline
Source Artifact \(\{source\_type\}\): \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\{source\_content\}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\newline
\newline
Target Artifact \(\{target\_type\}\): \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\{target\_content\}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\newline
\newline
Please analyze the content of both artifacts and determine if they are related. For the purpose of this analysis, consider the following criteria:\newline
1. \*\*Purpose\*\*: Do both artifacts serve a similar goal or objective within the software development process?\newline
2. \*\*Functionality\*\*: Do both artifacts provide similar features or capabilities?\newline
3. \*\*Requirements\*\*: Do both artifacts address the same requirements or constraints?\newline
\newline
Based on these criteria, answer with \textquotesingle{}yes\textquotesingle{} if they are related, or \textquotesingle{}no\textquotesingle{} if they are not related.
