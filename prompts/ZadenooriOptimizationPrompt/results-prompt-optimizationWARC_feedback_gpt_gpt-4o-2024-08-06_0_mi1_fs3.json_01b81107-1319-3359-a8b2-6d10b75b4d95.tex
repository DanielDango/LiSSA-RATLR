Question: Here are two parts of software development artifacts.\newline
\newline
\{source\_type\}: \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\{source\_content\}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\newline
\newline
\{target\_type\}: \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\{target\_content\}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\newline
Are they related?\newline
\newline
Answer with \textquotesingle{}yes\textquotesingle{} or \textquotesingle{}no\textquotesingle{}.\newline
\newline
Class Explanations:\newline
\newline
1. \*\*Yes\*\*: This classification is used when the two artifacts are directly related or connected in a meaningful way. For example, if one requirement specifies a feature or functionality that is directly supported or enabled by another requirement, they should be classified as \textquotesingle{}Yes\textquotesingle{}. In the provided examples, if a requirement specifies the need for a universal interface to create WARC records and another requirement details the types of WARC records that can be created through such an interface, they are related and should be classified as \textquotesingle{}Yes\textquotesingle{}.\newline
\newline
2. \*\*No\*\*: This classification is used when the two artifacts are not directly related or do not have a meaningful connection. For instance, if one requirement discusses the encapsulation of internal functionality and another requirement focuses on ensuring compatibility between versions, they address different aspects and should be classified as \textquotesingle{}No\textquotesingle{}. In the examples provided, if one requirement specifies the need for a single header file and another requirement details the types of WARC records, they are not directly related and should be classified as \textquotesingle{}No\textquotesingle{}.\newline

Incorporate these explanations to ensure accurate classification by identifying direct relationships or lack thereof between the requirements.
